## Deep Learning

### Classes：
* RBM：
  * First you should download the MNIST data from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
  * Then you can run pca.py, this code uses PCA to reduce the dimensionality of MNIST data from 784 to 2 and display it in graphic displays 
  * Run reducing_with_rbm.py, this code uses 784-1000-500-250-2 RBMs to train a model that can reduce the dimensionality of MNIST data from 784 to 2
